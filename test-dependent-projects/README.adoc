== Test projects for dependency declarations

The purpose of the subprojects in this directory is to test that the dependency
declarations in the main projects are good, so that downstream dependent
projects get all the transitive dependencies they need. The "tests" in here are
not primarily runtime functionality tests, but rather to make sure that the
tests themselves compile.
