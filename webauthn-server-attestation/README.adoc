An optional module which extends link:../[`webauthn-server-core`]
with a trust root source for verifying
https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/#sctn-attestation[attestation statements],
by interfacing with the https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/[FIDO Metadata Service].

== Features

This module does four things:

- Download, verify and cache metadata BLOBs from the FIDO Metadata Service.
- Re-download the metadata BLOB when out of date or invalid.
- Provide utilities for selecting trusted metadata entries and authenticators.
- Integrate with the
  link:https://developers.yubico.com/java-webauthn-server/JavaDoc/webauthn-server-core-minimal/latest/com/yubico/webauthn/RelyingParty.html[`RelyingParty`]
  class in the base library, to provide trust root certificates
  for verifying attestation statements during credential registrations.

Notable *non-features* include:

- *Scheduled BLOB downloads.*
+
The `FidoMetadataDownloader`
class will attempt to download a new BLOB only when its `loadBlob()` is executed,
and then only if the cache is empty or if the cached BLOB is invalid or out of date.
`FidoMetadataService`
will never re-download a new BLOB once instantiated.
+
You should use some external scheduling mechanism to re-run `loadBlob()` periodically
and rebuild new `FidoMetadataService` instances with the updated metadata contents.
You can do this with minimal disruption since the `FidoMetadataService` and `RelyingParty`
classes keep no internal mutable state.

- *Revocation of already-registered credentials*
+
The FIDO Metadata Service may from time to time report security issues with particular authenticator models.
The `FidoMetadataService` class can be configured with a filter for which authenticators to trust,
and untrusted authenticators can be rejected during registration by setting `.allowUntrustedAttestation(false)` on `RelyingParty`,
but this will not affect any credentials already registered.


== Before you start

It is important to be aware that *requiring attestation is an invasive policy*,
especially when used to restrict users' choice of authenticator.
For some applications this is necessary; for most it is not.
Similarly, *attestation does not automatically make your users more secure*.
Attestation gives you information, but you have to know what to do with that information
in order to get a security benefit from it; it is a powerful tool but does very little on its own.
This library can help retrieve and verify additional information about an authenticator,
and enforce some very basic policy based on it,
but it is your responsibility to further leverage that information into improved security.

When in doubt, err towards being more permissive, because _using WebAuthn is more secure than not using WebAuthn_.
It may still be useful to request and store attestation information for future reference -
for example, to warn users if security issues are discovered in their authenticators -
but we recommend that you do not _require_ a trusted attestation unless you have specific reason to do so.


== Migrating from version `1.x`

See link:doc/Migrating_from_v1.adoc[the migration guide].


== Getting started

Using this module consists of 4 major steps:

 1. Create a
    `FidoMetadataDownloader`
    instance to download and cache metadata BLOBs,
    and a
    `FidoMetadataService`
    instance to make use of the downloaded BLOB.
    See the JavaDoc for these classes for details on how to construct them.
+
[WARNING]
=====
Unlike other classes in this module and the core library,
`FidoMetadataDownloader` is NOT THREAD SAFE since its `loadBlob()` method reads and writes caches.
`FidoMetadataService`, on the other hand, is thread safe,
and `FidoMetadataDownloader` instances can be reused for subsequent `loadBlob()` calls
as long as only one `loadBlob()` call executes at a time.
=====
+
[source,java]
----------
FidoMetadataDownloader downloader = FidoMetadataDownloader.builder()
  .expectLegalHeader("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet")
  .useDefaultTrustRoot()
  .useTrustRootCacheFile(new File("/var/cache/webauthn-server/fido-mds-trust-root.bin"))
  .useDefaultBlob()
  .useBlobCacheFile(new File("/var/cache/webauthn-server/fido-mds-blob.bin"))
  .build();

FidoMetadataService mds = FidoMetadataService.builder()
  .useBlob(downloader.loadBlob())
  .build();
----------

 2. Set the `FidoMetadataService` as the `attestationTrustSource` on your
    link:https://developers.yubico.com/java-webauthn-server/JavaDoc/webauthn-server-core-minimal/latest/com/yubico/webauthn/RelyingParty.html[`RelyingParty`]
    instance,
    and set `attestationConveyancePreference(AttestationConveyancePreference.DIRECT)` on `RelyingParty`
    to request an attestation statement for new registrations.
    Optionally also set `.allowUntrustedAttestation(false)` on `RelyingParty` to require trusted attestation for new registrations.
+
[source,java]
----------
RelyingParty rp = RelyingParty.builder()
  .identity(/* ... */)
  .credentialRepository(/* ... */)
  .attestationTrustSource(mds)
  .attestationConveyancePreference(AttestationConveyancePreference.DIRECT)
  .allowUntrustedAttestation(true) // Optional step: set to true (default) or false
  .build();
----------

 3. After performing registrations, inspect the `isAttestationTrusted()` result in
    link:https://developers.yubico.com/java-webauthn-server/JavaDoc/webauthn-server-core-minimal/latest/com/yubico/webauthn/RelyingParty.html[`RelyingParty`]
    to determine whether the authenticator presented an attestation statement that could be verified
    by any of the trusted attestation certificates in the FIDO Metadata Service.
+
[source,java]
----------
RelyingParty rp = /* ... */;
RegistrationResult result = rp.finishRegistration(/* ... */);

if (result.isAttestationTrusted()) {
  // Do something...
} else {
  // Do something else...
}
----------

 4. If needed, use the `findEntries` methods of `FidoMetadataService` to retrieve additional authenticator metadata for new registrations.
+
[source,java]
----------
RelyingParty rp = /* ... */;
RegistrationResult result = rp.finishRegistration(/* ... */);

Set<MetadataBLOBPayloadEntry> metadata = mds.findEntries(result);
----------

By default, `FidoMetadataDownloader` will probably use the SUN provider for the `PKIX` certificate path validation algorithm.
This requires the `com.sun.security.enableCRLDP` system property set to `true` in order to verify the BLOB signature.
For example, this can be done on the JVM command line using a `-Dcom.sun.security.enableCRLDP=true` option.
See the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/security/java-pki-programmers-guide.htm#JSSEC-GUID-EB250086-0AC1-4D60-AE2A-FC7461374746[Java PKI Programmers Guide]
for details.


== Selecting trusted authenticators

The
`FidoMetadataService`
class can be configured with filters for which authenticators to trust.
When the `FidoMetadataService` is used as the `.attestationTrustSource()` in `RelyingParty`,
this will be reflected in the `.isAttestationTrusted()` result in
link:https://developers.yubico.com/java-webauthn-server/JavaDoc/webauthn-server-core-minimal/latest/com/yubico/webauthn/RegistrationResult.html[`RegistrationResult`].
Any authenticators not trusted will also be rejected for new registrations if you set `.allowUntrustedAttestation(false)` on `RelyingParty`.

The filter has two stages: a "prefilter" which selects metadata entries to include in the data source,
and a registration-time filter which decides whether to associate a metadata entry
with a particular authenticator.
The prefilter executes only once (per metadata entry):
when the `FidoMetadataService` instance is constructed.
The registration-time filter takes effect during credential registration
and in the `findEntries()` methods of `FidoMetadataService`.
The following figure illustrates where each filter appears in the data flows:

The default prefilter excludes any authenticator with any `REVOKED`
link:https://fidoalliance.org/specs/mds/fido-metadata-service-v3.0-ps-20210518.html#dom-metadatablobpayloadentry-statusreports[status report]
entry,
and the default registration-time filter excludes any authenticator
with a matching `ATTESTATION_KEY_COMPROMISE` status report entry.
To customize the filters, configure the `.prefilter(Predicate)` and `.filter(Predicate)` settings
in the `FidoMetadataService` builder.
The filters are predicate functions;
each metadata entry will be trusted if and only if the prefilter predicate returns `true` for that entry.
Similarly during registration or metadata lookup, the authenticator will be matched with each metadata entry
only if the registration-time filter returns `true` for that pair of authenticator and metadata entry.
You can also use the `FidoMetadataService.Filters.allOf()` combinator to merge several predicates into one.

[NOTE]
=====
Setting a custom filter will replace the default filter.
This is true for both the prefilter and the registration-time filter.
If you want to maintain the default filter in addition to the new behaviour,
you must include the default condition in the new filter.
For example, you can use `FidoMetadataService.Filters.allOf()` to combine a predefined filter with a custom one.
The default filters are available via static functions in `FidoMetadataService.Filters`.
=====


=== A note on "allow-lists" vs "deny-lists"

The filtering functionality described above essentially expresses an "allow-list" policy.
Any metadata entry that satisfies the filters is eligible as a trust root;
any attestation statement that can be verified by one of those trust roots is trusted,
and any that cannot is not trusted.
There is no complementary "deny-list" option to reject some specific authenticators
and implicitly trust everything else even with unknown trust roots.
This is because you cannot use such a deny list to enforce an attestation policy.

If unknown attestation trust roots were permitted,
then a deny list could be easily circumvented by making up an attestation that is not on the deny list.
Since it will have an unknown trust root, it would then be implicitly trusted.
This is why any enforceable attestation policy must disallow unknown trust roots.

Note that unknown and untrusted attestation is allowed by default,
but can be disallowed by explicitly configuring `RelyingParty` with `.allowUntrustedAttestation(false)`.


== Alignment with FIDO MDS spec

The FIDO Metadata Service specification defines
link:https://fidoalliance.org/specs/mds/fido-metadata-service-v3.0-ps-20210518.html#metadata-blob-object-processing-rules[processing rules for servers].
The library implements these as closely as possible, but with some slight departures from the spec:

* Processing rules steps 1-7 are implemented as specified, by the `FidoMetadataDownloader` class.
  All "SHOULD" clauses are also respected, with some caveats:

 ** Step 3 states "The `nextUpdate` field of the Metadata BLOB specifies a date when the download SHOULD occur at latest".
    `FidoMetadataDownloader` does not automatically re-download the BLOB.
    Instead, each time its `.loadBlob()` method is executed it checks whether a new BLOB should be downloaded.
+
If no BLOB exists in cache, or the cached BLOB is invalid, or if the current date is greater than or equal to `nextUpdate`,
then a new BLOB is downloaded.
If the new BLOB is valid, has a correct signature, and has a `no` field greater than the cached BLOB,
then the new BLOB replaces the cached one;
otherwise, the new BLOB is discarded and the cached one is kept until the next execution of `.loadBlob()`.

* Metadata entries are not stored or cached individually, instead the BLOB is cached as a whole.
  In processing rules step 8, neither `FidoMetadataDownloader` nor `FidoMetadataService`
  performs any comparison between versions of a metadata entry.
  Policy for ignoring metadata entries can be configured via the filter settings in `FidoMetadataService`.
  See above for details.

There are also some other requirements throughout the spec, which may not be obvious:

* The
  link:https://fidoalliance.org/specs/mds/fido-metadata-service-v3.0-ps-20210518.html#info-statuses[AuthenticatorStatus section]
  states that "The Relying party MUST reject the Metadata Statement if the `authenticatorVersion` has not increased"
  in an `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` status report.
  Thus, `FidoMetadataService` silently ignores any `MetadataBLOBPayloadEntry`
  whose `metadataStatement.authenticatorVersion` is present and not greater than or equal to
  the `authenticatorVersion` in the respective status report.
  Again, no comparison is made between metadata entries from different BLOB versions.

* The
  link:https://fidoalliance.org/specs/mds/fido-metadata-service-v3.0-ps-20210518.html#info-statuses[AuthenticatorStatus section]
  states that "FIDO Servers MUST silently ignore all unknown AuthenticatorStatus values".
  Thus any unknown status valus will be parsed as `AuthenticatorStatus.UNKNOWN`,
  and `MetadataBLOBPayloadEntry` will silently ignore any status report with that status.


== Overriding certificate path validation

The `FidoMetadataDownloader` class uses `CertPathValidator.getInstance("PKIX")` to retrieve a `CertPathValidator` instance.
If you need to override any aspect of certificate path validation,
such as CRL retrieval or OCSP, you may provide a custom `CertPathValidator` provider for the `"PKIX"` algorithm.
